# The-Bodyweight-Gym-Online
We've designed a sleek and user friendly follow along workout web application that helps users with their at home workout routines. 
<br />
This application was designed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.
<br />
<p>
The styling was completed using the Bulma CSS framework, keeping the design simple and easy to follow. The user is asked to "log in" using a pop up modal, where the user is able to input their name and their location, which are both stored into local storage.
  </p>
  <p>
  The features include a filter of routines and trainers, along with the ability to favorite a video, which is then stored on the users favorite page, which can be accessed using the heart favicon in the top right corner of the navigation bar. Once a video is selected, the user is taken to a new web page where the selected video is displayed and the user is able to play. Above the video player, there is a weather display, that uses the users location input to display their local weather using a weather API, also letting the user know if they can train inside out outside based on the chances of rain. The user has the option to press a button for motivation, that displays a pop up modal, which calls upon a Giffy API and and shows the user a Chuck gif, along with a Chuck Norris quote called with an API. The user is able to apply a metronome function by clicking on the metronome icon, which will play a metronome sound.
